The error message "Incorrect value for field params second parameter is expected" indicates that there might be a formatting issue with the preprocessing configuration. Let's make sure the parameters are set correctly:

1. **Navigate to the item**: Go to the Zabbix web interface and locate the item where you want to extract the `DBSize`.

2. **Edit the item**: Click on the item.

3. **Go to preprocessing**: Navigate to the "Preprocessing" tab.

4. **Create preprocessing rule**: Click on the "Create Preprocessing" button.

5. **Choose preprocessing type**: Select "Regular expression" from the dropdown menu.

6. **Set up the regular expression**: In the "Regular expression" field, enter the regular expression to extract the numeric value associated with `DBSize`. For example, `DBSize:(\d+)`.

7. **Set the `Type of data`**: Choose the appropriate data type for the output, such as "Numeric (float)" or "Numeric (unsigned)" depending on the nature of the extracted value.

8. **Save the preprocessing rule**: Once you're satisfied with the configuration, click "Add" or "Save" to create the preprocessing rule.

Make sure that all parameters are correctly filled, including the regular expression and the type of data. If you're still encountering the error, double-check each field to ensure they are properly configured.
