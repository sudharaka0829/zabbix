The command you provided is a good start, but it might need some adjustments to retrieve the specific details you mentioned. Here's an updated command that includes the Process ID, User, CPU usage, Memory usage, and Process Command Line:

```plaintext
system.run[tasklist /v /fo csv | findstr /i /r /c:"\\[^\\]*$" | sort /r /+6 /c | head -n 6 | cut -d "," -f 2,3,5,6,9]
```

Let's break down the updated command:

- `tasklist /v /fo csv`: Lists all running processes in CSV format along with verbose information.
- `findstr /i /r /c:"\\[^\\]*$"`: Filters the processes to find lines ending with a backslash, which typically indicates a file process.
- `sort /r /+6 /c`: Sorts the filtered list in reverse order based on the sixth column, which represents the CPU or memory usage.
- `head -n 6`: Displays the top six lines of the sorted output. The first line will be the header, and the next five lines will contain details of the top five processes.
- `cut -d "," -f 2,3,5,6,9`: Extracts specific fields from the CSV output. Here, we're selecting the second, third, fifth, sixth, and ninth fields, which correspond to Process ID, User, CPU usage, Memory usage, and Process Command Line respectively.

Ensure that the Zabbix item key is correctly configured to use this command. Once configured, Zabbix will execute this command at specified intervals, and you can monitor the results in the Latest Data section under Monitoring > Latest data in the Zabbix frontend.

### Example Zabbix Item Key:
- `Key`: `system.run[tasklist /v /fo csv | findstr /i /r /c:"\\[^\\]*$" | sort /r /+6 /c | head -n 6 | cut -d "," -f 2,3,5,6,9]`

This command will return details of the top five processes including their Process ID, User, CPU usage, Memory usage, and Process Command Line. Adjust the command parameters as needed to fit your specific requirements.

Make sure to test the command outside of Zabbix to ensure it provides the desired output on your Windows system.
