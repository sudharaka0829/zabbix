Items:
Zabbix 5:

Example Items:

CPU Load: system.cpu.load[,avg1]
Memory Usage: vm.memory.size[available]
Disk Space Usage: vfs.fs.size[C:,pfree]
Network Traffic: net.if.in[Ethernet0]
Description: Monitors essential system metrics such as average CPU load, available memory, free disk space percentage on the C: drive, and inbound network traffic on Ethernet0 interface.

Zabbix 7:

Example Items:

Detailed CPU Usage: system.cpu.util[,guest] (monitors CPU utilization by guest processes)
Memory Usage Breakdown: vm.memory.size[cached], vm.memory.size[used]
Disk I/O Operations: vfs.dev.write.ops[C:] (monitors write operations on the C: drive)
Network Traffic and Errors: net.if.out[Ethernet0], net.if.out.errors[Ethernet0]
Description: Provides even more detailed metrics, including CPU utilization by guest processes, additional memory statistics such as cached and used memory, write operations on the C: drive, and both outbound traffic and errors on the Ethernet0 network interface.

Triggers:
Zabbix 5:

Example Triggers:

High CPU Usage: avg(system.cpu.load[,avg1],5m)>75
Low Disk Space: last(vfs.fs.size[C:,pfree])<20
Description: Basic triggers that alert when the average CPU load is higher than 75% over 5 minutes or when free disk space is below 20%.

Zabbix 7:

Example Triggers:

High Guest CPU Usage: avg(system.cpu.util[,guest],5m)>85
Low Cached Memory Warning: last(vm.memory.size[cached])<300M
High Disk Write Latency: avg(vfs.dev.write.ops[C:],5m)>120
Network Outbound Errors: sum(net.if.out.errors[Ethernet0],1h)>1
Description: More refined triggers with conditions like high guest-specific CPU usage over 85%, low cached memory below 300MB, high disk write operations latency, and any outbound network interface errors in the last hour.

Graphs:
Zabbix 5:

Example Graphs:

CPU Load Graph: Displays the average CPU load over time.
Memory Usage Graph: Shows available memory over time.
Description: Standard graphs for basic metrics providing a visual representation of data trends.

Zabbix 7:

Example Graphs:

Detailed CPU Usage Graph: Separate lines for user, system, guest, and idle CPU utilization.
Memory Usage Breakdown Graph: Displays total, free, cached, and used memory over time.
Disk I/O Operations Graph: Shows read and write operations separately, including latency.
Network Traffic and Errors Graph: Includes traffic, inbound and outbound errors for a comprehensive view.
Description: Enhanced graphing capabilities with more interactive and customizable graphs, allowing for better data visualization and analysis.

Discovery Rules:
Zabbix 5:

Example Discovery Rules:

File System Discovery: Automatically finds and monitors all file systems.
Network Interface Discovery: Detects and monitors all network interfaces.
Description: Basic discovery rules for identifying file systems and network interfaces.

Zabbix 7:

Example Discovery Rules:

Extended File System Discovery: Finds file systems and includes detailed metrics like I/O statistics and access times.
Enhanced Network Interface Discovery: Discovers network interfaces with error statistics, traffic analysis, and bandwidth utilization.
Description: More robust discovery rules that include additional resource types and improved detection algorithms.

Tags:
Zabbix 5:

Description: Does not utilize tags.

Zabbix 7:

Example Tags:

CPU Monitoring Tag: resource=cpu
Memory Alert Tag: resource=memory
Disk Space Tag: resource=disk
Network Error Tag: resource=network,error
Description: Introduces the use of tags for better categorization and filtering. For instance, CPU-related items and triggers can be tagged with resource=cpu, making it easier to manage and search for relevant alerts and issues. This allows for more organized and efficient monitoring setup and maintenance.
