Hi Deepa/ Ravi, 
Please find the below MOM for your reference.
 
1] Servers not in Zabbix based on the inventory provided. (Windows, Unix, NW) . Bi-weekly report.
  Need to cross-check the Windows/ Linux/ Network inventories with Zabbix production environment.
  
  Linux -> 600 server analysis has been done, Moving with windows servers. 
      
2] JVM Monitoring 
  Need to check the JAVA gateway status in Zabbix UAT server.
  WebLogic Monitoring Using JVM has been done and moving with JBOSS , WebSphere and need to check the items which are not working.

  DB2Bix integration with DB2
  Need to do more R&D with the DB2, DBForBix, Zabbix configurations. 
  
4] Need to check the status of top five process in windows and Linux environments.
  we can do it using two methods. 
  1] using shell script on each server | This has been done 
  2] run Zabbix item key system.run[] and retrive data, checking the feasibility on it. 
  
 Commands ->
  windows : system.run[powershell -Command "Get-Process | Sort-Object PM -Descending | Select-Object -First 5 | Format-Table -Property Id, ProcessName, CPU, PM -AutoSize"]
  Linux : system.run[ps -eo pid,comm,%cpu,%mem --sort=-%cpu | head -n 6,nowait]
 
5] Log monitoring problem alerts clearing
  Need to clear problem alerts in 25 hours related to log monitoring.   
  we can use expression nodata()     
               
6] Need to check Zabbix auto registration using metadata. 
    Initial analysis has been done and need to config it with Zabbix 7
