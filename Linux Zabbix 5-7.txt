Items:
Zabbix 5:

Example Items:

CPU Load: system.cpu.load[percpu,avg1]
Memory Usage: vm.memory.size[available]
Disk Space Usage: vfs.fs.size[/,pfree]
Network Traffic: net.if.in[eth0]
Description: Monitors essential system metrics such as per-CPU average load, available memory, free disk space percentage on the root (/) partition, and inbound network traffic on a specific network interface.

Zabbix 7:

Example Items:

Detailed CPU Usage: system.cpu.util[,guest] (monitors CPU utilization by guest processes)
Memory Usage Breakdown: vm.memory.size[cached], vm.memory.size[used]
Disk I/O Operations: vfs.dev.write.ops[sda] (monitors write operations on a specific disk)
Network Traffic and Errors: net.if.out[eth0], net.if.out.errors[eth0]
Description: Provides even more detailed metrics, including CPU utilization by guest processes, additional memory statistics such as cached and used memory, write operations on disks, and both outbound traffic and errors on network interfaces.

Triggers:
Zabbix 5:

Example Triggers:

High CPU Usage: avg(system.cpu.load[percpu,avg1],5m)>75
Low Disk Space: last(vfs.fs.size[/,pfree])<20
Description: Basic triggers that alert when the per-CPU average load is higher than 75% over 5 minutes or when free disk space is below 20%.

Zabbix 7:

Example Triggers:

High Guest CPU Usage: avg(system.cpu.util[,guest],5m)>85
Low Cached Memory Warning: last(vm.memory.size[cached])<300M
High Disk Write Latency: avg(vfs.dev.write.ops[sda],5m)>120
Network Outbound Errors: sum(net.if.out.errors[eth0],1h)>1
Description: More refined triggers with conditions like high guest-specific CPU usage over 85%, low cached memory below 300MB, high disk write operations latency, and any outbound network interface errors in the last hour.

Graphs:
Zabbix 5:

Example Graphs:

CPU Load Graph: Displays the per-CPU average load over time.
Memory Usage Graph: Shows available memory over time.
Description: Standard graphs for basic metrics providing a visual representation of data trends.

Zabbix 7:

Example Graphs:

Detailed CPU Usage Graph: Separate lines for user, system, guest, and idle CPU utilization.
Memory Usage Breakdown Graph: Displays total, free, cached, and used memory over time.
Disk I/O Operations Graph: Shows read and write operations separately, including latency.
Network Traffic and Errors Graph: Includes traffic, inbound and outbound errors for a comprehensive view.
Description: Enhanced graphing capabilities with more interactive and customizable graphs, allowing for better data visualization and analysis.

Discovery Rules:
Zabbix 5:

Example Discovery Rules:

File System Discovery: Automatically finds and monitors all file systems.
Network Interface Discovery: Detects and monitors all network interfaces.
Description: Basic discovery rules for identifying file systems and network interfaces.

Zabbix 7:

Example Discovery Rules:

Extended File System Discovery: Finds file systems and includes detailed metrics like I/O statistics and access times.
Enhanced Network Interface Discovery: Discovers network interfaces with error statistics, traffic analysis, and bandwidth utilization.
Description: More robust discovery rules that include additional resource types and improved detection algorithms.

Tags:
Zabbix 5:

Description: Does not utilize tags.

Zabbix 7:

Example Tags:

CPU Monitoring Tag: resource=cpu
Memory Alert Tag: resource=memory
Disk Space Tag: resource=disk
Network Error Tag: resource=network,error
Description: Introduces the use of tags for better categorization and filtering. For instance, CPU-related items and triggers can be tagged with resource=cpu, making it easier to manage and search for relevant alerts and issues. This allows for more organized and efficient monitoring setup and maintenance.
