Detailed Comparison:
Items:
Zabbix 5:

Example Items:

CPU Load: system.cpu.util[,avg1]
Memory Usage: vm.memory.size[available]
Disk Space Usage: vfs.fs.size[C:,pfree]
Network Traffic: net.if.in[Ethernet0]
Description: Monitors essential system metrics such as average CPU load, available memory, free disk space percentage on C: drive, and inbound network traffic on a specific interface.

Zabbix 6:

Example Items:

Detailed CPU Usage: system.cpu.util[,user] (monitors CPU utilization by user processes)
Memory Usage Breakdown: vm.memory.size[total], vm.memory.size[free], vm.memory.size[buffer]
Disk I/O Operations: vfs.dev.read.ops[C:] (monitors read operations on a specific disk)
Network Errors: net.if.in.errors[Ethernet0] (monitors inbound errors on a specific network interface)
Description: Adds more detailed metrics, including specific CPU utilization by different types of processes, more granular memory statistics, disk I/O operations, and network interface errors.

Triggers:
Zabbix 5:

Example Triggers:

High CPU Usage: avg(system.cpu.util[,avg1],5m)>75
Low Disk Space: last(vfs.fs.size[C:,pfree])<20
Description: Basic triggers that alert when the average CPU load is higher than 75% over 5 minutes or when free disk space is below 20%.

Zabbix 6:

Example Triggers:

High User CPU Usage: avg(system.cpu.util[,user],5m)>80
Low Memory Warning: last(vm.memory.size[free])<500M
Disk Read Operations Latency: avg(vfs.dev.read.ops[C:],5m)>100
Network Interface Errors: sum(net.if.in.errors[Ethernet0],1h)>0
Description: More refined triggers with conditions like high user-specific CPU usage over 80%, low free memory below 500MB, high disk read operations latency, and any network interface errors in the last hour.

Graphs:
Zabbix 5:

Example Graphs:

CPU Load Graph: Displays the average CPU load over time.
Memory Usage Graph: Shows available memory over time.
Description: Standard graphs for basic metrics providing a visual representation of data trends.

Zabbix 6:

Example Graphs:

Detailed CPU Usage Graph: Separate lines for user, system, and idle CPU utilization.
Memory Usage Breakdown Graph: Displays total, free, and buffer memory over time.
Disk I/O Operations Graph: Shows read and write operations separately.
Network Traffic and Errors Graph: Includes traffic and error metrics for a comprehensive view.
Description: Improved graphing capabilities with more interactive and customizable graphs, allowing for better data visualization and analysis.

Discovery Rules:
Zabbix 5:

Example Discovery Rules:

File System Discovery: Automatically finds and monitors all file systems.
Network Interface Discovery: Detects and monitors all network interfaces.
Description: Basic discovery rules for identifying file systems and network interfaces.

Zabbix 6:

Example Discovery Rules:

Extended File System Discovery: Finds file systems and also includes detailed metrics like I/O statistics.
Enhanced Network Interface Discovery: Discovers network interfaces along with error statistics and traffic analysis.
Description: More robust discovery rules that include additional resource types and improved detection algorithms.

Tags:
Zabbix 5:

Description: Does not utilize tags.
Zabbix 6:

Example Tags:

CPU Monitoring Tag: resource=cpu
Memory Alert Tag: resource=memory
Disk Space Tag: resource=disk
Network Error Tag: resource=network,error
Description: Introduces the use of tags for better categorization and filtering. For instance, CPU-related items and triggers can be tagged with resource=cpu, making it easier to manage and search for relevant alerts and issues.
