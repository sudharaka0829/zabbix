Install ODBC Driver Manager: Ensure that an ODBC driver manager is installed on the Zabbix server. You can use unixODBC, which is a common choice for Unix/Linux systems.
Install DB2 ODBC Driver: Install the IBM DB2 ODBC driver on the Zabbix server. You can download the appropriate driver from the IBM website or obtain it from your DB2 installation media.
Configure ODBC Driver: Configure the ODBC driver by editing the odbcinst.ini file (usually located in /etc/odbcinst.ini). Register the DB2 ODBC driver by adding an entry similar to the following:


[DB2]
Description = IBM DB2 ODBC Driver
Driver = <path_to_driver_library>


Replace <path_to_driver_library> with the path to the DB2 ODBC driver library file.
Configure ODBC Data Source: Edit the odbc.ini file (usually located in /etc/odbc.ini) to define a data source for your DB2 database. Add an entry similar to the following:


Replace <database_name>, <hostname_or_IP>, <port_number>, <username>, and <password> with the appropriate values for your DB2 database.
Test the ODBC Connection: Use tools like isql or osql to test the ODBC connection from the Zabbix server to the DB2 database. For example:



isql MyDB2DSN <username> <password>
